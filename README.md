# Machine Learning - Bank Churn
*Borja Teruelo, Carlos Azagra and Patricia Barrantes*

*Data Analytics Part Time - Barcelona - July 2021*


## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to **predict if a customer of this bank is going to churn or not**. For this, we have applied the different models and techniques learned during -specially- the third module of this bootcamp, such as:
- Data wrangling
- Clustering (_KMeans, DBSCAN_) 
- Dimensionality reduction (_PCA, TSNE_)
- Logistic Regression
- Data Scaling (_StandardScaler, Max Abs, Robust, Min Max_)
- Oversampling, undersampling and combined (_SMOTETomek, BorderlineSMOTE, SMOTE, TomekLinks_)
- Classifier (_DecisionTree, RandomForest_)
- Hyperparameter tunning
- Pipelines
